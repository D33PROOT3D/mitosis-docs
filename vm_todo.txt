Still to do:
    Solder the keyboard halves, program them
    Install QMK for Mitosis
    Write QMK instructions (or point to others)
    Test download of QMK to Pro Micro (Native OS X and Linux)
    Test the QMK compile and load
    Document the QMK part

    Start a new, empty VM. Follow my instructions to build it. Make sure it still works.
        Adjust instructions as needed.
    Publish instructions.
