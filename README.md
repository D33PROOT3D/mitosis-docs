# mitosis-docs

This directory is an in-process project to document the Mitosis wireless, split kayboard.

The keyboard was designed by reverse_bias (on reddit).

At the moment I am collecting feedback of two sections of it:
 * Build instructions: mitosis-buildinstructions.md
 * Parts list: mitosis-partslist.md
 
 Please send me comments, or pull requests for changes and improvements.
 
 Thank you.
