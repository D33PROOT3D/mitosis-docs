# mitosis-docs

This is an in-process project to gather and document all the information about
the Mitosis wireless, split keyboard in one place.

## The goal
The goal of this project is to suport builders of the Mitosis at all stages of
the project, with the hope that this result in many, many successful builds of
this keyboard.

## Topics
The topics to be covered are:
  * Overview
    * Design goals
    * Design documents
    * Physical description
    * User operation
    * Background (links, group buys)
  * Details
    * Electrical
    * Software
    * Firmware
    * Design??
  * Parts and Bill of materials
  * Tools and supplies
  * Software development (repositories, tools, libraries, installation, use, changing the software)
  * Hardware development (changing the PCB, future directions)
  * Future design thoughts
  * Hardware Assembly (building)
  * Resources

## Background
[/u/reverse_bias (reddedit)](https://www.reddit.com/user/reverse_bias) designed and created the 
keyboard, announcing and reveling 
it on [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/66588f/wireless_split_qmk_mitosis/), April 18, 2017.

I've become a bit obsessed with this keyboard while waiting for my build 
kit to arrive. While waiting I've been collecting all the available information 
on it that I could find, and started documenting it.

I've read some, but not too much of the code.

Where there was no information available I did my best to make intelegent
guesses about how thing (most likely) works. Some of the links to resources
included I found on the web.

At the moment I am collecting feedback on the first two, very important sections
of it:
 * Build instructions: mitosis-buildinstructions.md
 * Parts list: mitosis-partslist.md
 
Please send me comments, or pull requests for changes and improvements.
 
Thank you.
